# BugBot

Based on an older version of DTesters' Bug-Bot, this bot is designed to allow users to submit reports that go through community-approval and are then submitted to a repository as an issue (if they're approved). I find this incredibly useful as it acts as an easier way to provide as much detail as possible when reporting a bug.
